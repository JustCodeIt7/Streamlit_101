# 🔧 Ticker Input Implementation & Fixes

## ✅ Issue Resolution: Financial Statements Page Error

### **Problem**
The Financial Statements page was throwing an error when using real-time data:
```
Error: "['period', 'cost_of_revenue'] not in index"
```

This occurred because the page was trying to access fields that only exist in sample financial data, not in real-time data from yfinance.

### **Root Cause**
- Financial statements page was designed only for sample data
- Real-time financial data has a different structure than sample data
- Missing handling for custom stocks and real-time data scenarios

### **Solution Implemented**

#### 1. **Enhanced Real-Time Data Fetcher**
- **File:** `utils/real_data_fetcher.py`
- **Changes:** Added comprehensive financial metrics from yfinance
- **New Fields:** Revenue, EBITDA, cash flow, debt ratios, profitability margins, etc.

#### 2. **Updated Financial Statements Page**
- **File:** `pages/03_💰_financial_statements.py`
- **Changes:** 
  - Added detection for real-time vs sample data
  - Created alternative display for real-time financial data
  - Graceful fallback with informative messaging

#### 3. **Intelligent Data Source Handling**
- **Logic:** 
  - **Sample Data:** Full financial statements analysis (income, balance sheet, cash flow)
  - **Real-Time Data:** Key financial metrics from yfinance API
  - **Custom Stocks:** Automatic real-time data mode

```
